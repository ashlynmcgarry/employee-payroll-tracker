## Description

![Employee payroll tracker](https://github.com/ashlynmcgarry/employee-payroll-tracker/assets/166701777/89278233-3c99-41ac-bc01-ccc2cafca73d)

This Employee Payroll Tracker enables users to enter, view and manage employee payroll data. When opened a user is prompted to enter the first name, last name and salary of as many employees as necessary. Once completed, the table populates with the inputted data. From here, the user is able to open the console and will be presented with an array of the employee data alongisde a average salary of the entered employees and a randomly drawn winner. 

Throughout this project I learned to utilise a range of Javascript functions to make the application interactive and functional. Some of the Javascript tools used included declaring variables, while loops, NaN, arrays, return, average and the Math object. 

## Installation
